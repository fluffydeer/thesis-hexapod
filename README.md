# Remote controlled Hexapod

The aim of the bachelor thesis is to create a six-legged robot which would be able to move and be controlled remotely. The problems of hexapods, their advantages and disadvantages and the analysis of the current situation in this field is described.  
We had to design a suitable construction for the body and legs and choose enough degrees of freedom. The model was printed with the use of 3D printer.  
There are several factors we bear in mind while choosing the hardware. We choose hardware composed of analog servo motors, servo shields, microcontroller, voltage regulator and external power source.  
It is assembled with the printed parts and programmed in Arduino IDE. The communication between the robot and the phone application is handled with the help of UDP datagrams. The movement of the robot depends on inverse kinematics. It can move forward, to the sides and turn in place. The application for the remote controlling is programmed for phones with Android OS using Java. The project was finished and defended in June 2019.
